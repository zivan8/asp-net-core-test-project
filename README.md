This is a simple ASP.NET Core MVC project desinged for my own testing and learning purposes.
Pretty basic stuff, but i'll be working on more modules once i catch up some free time :)

Visualizing JSON data via HTML table using C#
This program creates a html page, showing a table of employees that are ordered by
the total time worked. The table shows the Name and the Total time worked.
Table row is coloured if the employee has worked less than 100 hours.
Pie chart button will generate a PNG (image) file using the data from the REST endpoint.
Pie-chart will be showing a percentage of the total time worked by an employee.

Cheers!
